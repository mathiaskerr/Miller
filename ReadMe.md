# Task

## Problem task
* A user has gone outwith the Service Desk and got in touch with the team directly to let us know  that they are getting an issue when trying to browse to our Call Off app using their work phone
* There is a clear urgency to this issue, since they have not gone through Service Desk as per process, and it could mean that the entire application is down for all users
* What do you do to try and troubleshoot the issue?
* Do you interact with the user? If yes, then how and what do you say to them? 
* Do you let anyone else know about the issue?
* When you manage to close out the issue, what do you do regarding the user who logged the issue in the first place?
***

1. Assess Situation with available information. (has this happened before etc?)

2. Let my manager know what I know and that I will try to help out. Do this via appropriate contact method at the time.

3. Interact with the user. Express gratitude and show empathy. Gather further information about the issue such as if the problem is happening on multiple devices, networks or locations.

4. Talk user through some simple troubleshooting ie, turning device off and on again, re-installing app, clear cache and if it a browser version exists, try that one.
5. During this time I can also be doing any checks on my end to see if it is a system wide problem. If I am in office with other people or able to easily contact any colleagues during this process I could have them run some of these tests to find a quicker solution.

6. During this whole process or directly after I will be documenting the whole process as further investigation may be required or to help prevent this issue in the future.

7. If none of the above has been successful I would escalate appropriately by contacting the service desk, my manager and possibly the team responsible for the Call Off app. The service desk will be brought up to speed with what actions have already been taken. Their advice here might be very valuable as it might be something they have encountered before.

8. During this process I would be keeping the user informed and advise them to the best of my ability.

9. Once the issue is resolved I will contact the user and stay on the line to confirm the app is working. After I confirm that I will advise the user to follow the proper procedure by calling the service desk as this will lead to a quicker solution for them.

10. At the end of this I will reflect on what I have learned and share this with the team and service desk to see what can be done to improve this process.
